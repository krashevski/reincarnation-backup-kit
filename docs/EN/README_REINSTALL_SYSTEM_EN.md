How to install Ubuntu on an SSD and run Backup Kit scripts

---

## Installing Ubuntu on an SSD

1. Install Ubuntu on the SSD as usual.
2. Create one user (e.g., admin) for system administration.
3. Configure system languages ‚Äã‚Äãand keyboard.
3. The system is ready to run subsequent scripts.

## Executing `hdd-setup-profiles.sh`

- The script is run as root.
- Formats the selected HDD and creates three partitions for users.
- Creates users:
1. `admin` (existing)
2. `USER2` and `USER3` (new users with a temporary password of `password`)
- Adds partition UUIDs to `/etc/fstab` and mounts them.
- Logs are saved to `/mnt/backups/logs/hdd_setup_profiles_restore.log`.

## Installing the multimedia environment `install_mediatools_flatpak.sh`

- The script will automatically check your NVIDIA system for GPU and CUDA support.
- Installs the multimedia environments Shotcut, GIMP+G'MIC, Krita, and Audacity from the Flathub repository.
- Creates directories for the Shotcut Proxy and symbolic links to large file directories. - Configure Shotcut (Proxy + Preview Scaling)
- Create ready-made Shotcut presets for saving
- Test GPU and ffmpeg for Shotcut

## Automatic NVIDIA configuration, GPU passthrough to Flatpak `check-shotcut-gpu.sh`

This script automatically configures NVIDIA, passes the GPU to Flatpak, and tests NVENC for GPU configuration for Shotcut.

## Run `restore.sh`

- Detects the distribution (`ubuntu-22.04`, `ubuntu-24.04`, etc.).
- Runs the corresponding system restore script:
- `restore-ubuntu-XX.XX.sh`
- Restores the system, packages, and configurations to the SSD.

## Running safe-restore-userdata.sh

- This script is best run manually in the local TTY3 console (Cirl+Alt+F3) without a graphical shell.
- Restores home directories and user data from a backup.
- All three users (admin, USER2, USER3) are accessible.

## Changing temporary passwords

After recovery, the administrator changes the temporary passwords for USER2 and USER3 to something secure.
Example:
```bash
passwd USER2
passwd USER3
```

## Installing software from the APT repository

Cleaning up unnecessary repositories and installing software from the APT or Snap repository: VLC, DigiKam, Darktable, KeePassXC, Telegram-desktop, Midnight Commander, ranger, CPU-X.
```bash
install_mediatools_apt.sh
```

## Summary:

- SSD with one user (admin) ‚Üí HDD with three partitions and users.
- After running restore.sh and safe-restore-userdata.sh, the system is completely restored.
- Temporary passwords are easy to change.
